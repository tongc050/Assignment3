                    <h3>Drawing</h3>
                    <p>I've been drawing since I was about 10(?) years old until now. I started off doing anime drawings and wanted to 
                        improve my style and try to do semi-realistic art style. I started off traditionally with pencil and paper and after
                        a while I transfered to digital art, using a drawing tablet. I just got back to drawing after the quarantine thing
                    </p>

                    <h3>Video Games</h3>
                    <p class = "text">I wouldn't exactly call myself a hardcore "gamer girl" since I only play games that are available for me. 
                        I only play games that are available for PC, free or cheap, and something my laptop can carry. I would really
                        want to own a console one day so I can play the newer and cooler games. I'm a sucker for action-adventure and open-world games that have good and fun plot line and character creation. 
                        League of Legends is a MOBA or Multiplayer Online Battle Arena and probably one of my only go to games when I want to play with friends. Other than action games I also enjoy
                        interaction and platform-adventure games with amazing music score and visuals.
                        <br><br>
                        Here are some of the games I've played and currently have:

                    <h3>Dancing</h3>
                    <p>I started dancing back in 8th grade but it was just to k-pop songs. Soon enough I tried joining a small dance group
                        in Grade 11 and since then I've been practicing. I wouldn't say I'm good but I try. I prefer dancing styles like this
